# This is the h1 header for the markup skill course

## This is h2, relatively smaller than h1

### And here we have an even smaller one, h3

Here is a code example to test correct markdown:

```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```

The following one is to test javascript markdown:

```javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```

Here I am adding an image too:

![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)


I just tried header 1, 2 and 3 in this file and also added an image.
